== Neo4j Elastic{Search} Integration

Integrates Neo4j change-feed with an ElasticSearch cluster.

=== Approach

This Neo4j Kernel Extension updates an ElasticSearch instance or cluster with changes in the graph.

A transaction event listener checks changed Nodes against a given label, renders the whole node as json document and indexes all changes in bulk with ES.

=== Installation

* Clone this repository and run `mvn install -DskipTests`
* Copy the `jar` files in `target/dependencies` to your Neo4j instance's
  `plugins` folder
* Also copy `target/neo4j-elasticsearch-2.2-SNAPSHOT.jar` to the
  `plugins` folder
* Modify `conf/neo4j.properties` accordingly (see the Example section)
* Restart Neo4j

=== Example

Suppose that we keep nodes in our Neo4j instance labeled `Person` and
`Place`, and that we want to index the values of the `first_name` and
`last_name` properties of the former and `name` of the latter in two
separate ElasticSearch indices named `people` and `places`. For that,
we would add the following directives to `conf/neo4j.properties`:

----
elasticsearch.host_name=http://localhost:9200
elasticsearch.index_spec=people:Person(first_name,last_name), places:Place(name)
----

With that in place, Neo4j will now track changes to nodes labeled
`Person` or `Place` and keep our ES instance running on
`localhost:9200` in sync.

Suppose that we also want to index all nodes (independent of label or scheme)
in a separate index called `all_nodes`, we would add the following directive 
below the previous:

----
elasticsearch.index_all=all_nodes
----

The first two directives (`host_name` and `index_spec`) are required. The latter 
(`index_all`) is optional.

To perform an initial import, you can force a commit by executing a
Cypher query like:

----
MATCH n:Person
SET n.first_name = n.first_name, n.last_name = n.last_name;

MATCH n:Place
SET n.name = n.name;
----

=== Developing

To run the tests, run `mvn test`. Make sure that an elastic{search} server is running on
`localhost:9200`.



=== Todo

* Support indexing of relationships
